# QDrink
> Little stone of software developed for educational purposes


QDrink is a simple Cocktail Recipe Notes keeper. QDrink was developed with the hobby idea in 
mind because in my free time I like doing mixology :)


### Functionalities
The application makes possible for you to:
1. CRUD operations on **QDrink** Cocktail Cookbook;
2. Backup loader and saver;
3. BAC Calculator.


### Gui Language
At this moment the application language is italian.

### Future work
1. Refactoring;
2. GUI modularization;
3. Improve Memory Management;
4. Add new user functionalities;
5. Internationalization;
6. Cross Platform Porting.

## System requirements
The application was tested and executed under Fedora OS. During developement 
I used the fourth version of Qt. 
So, before installing it's requested local installation of Qt4. It also 
should work with Qt5. 
 

## How you can install QDrink
The local installation requires the following couple of steps:
1. git clone https://github.com/apetrovYa/QDrink.git qdrink
2. cd qdrink
3. qmake-qt4 && make 
4. make clean

## How you can execute
In the current installation directory, from console type the following
command: 
1. ./QDrink

> `Now the app should be executing`.

## Licensing

The code in this project is "without licence".
