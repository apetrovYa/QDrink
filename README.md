# QDrink
> Little stone of software developed for educational purposes


QDrink is a simple Cocktail Recipe Notes keeper. Is very tiny and flexible.
I developed it with two ideas in mind:

 1. By technological point of view: to experiment function object oriented programming;
 2. By my point of view: to develop something useful from scratch for my hobby "Mixology".

### Functionalities

The application makes possible for you to:
1. CRUD operations on **QDrink** Cocktail Cookbook;
2. Backup loader and saver;
3. BAC Calculator.


### Internationalization

At this moment the application language is italian.

### Future work

1. Code refactoring;
2. GUI modularization;
3. Improve Memory Management;
4. Add new user functionalities;
5. Internationalization;
6. Cross Platform Porting.



## Installing  / Getting Started

To let you use and try QDrink you have to do couple of things:

1. Download or clone QDrink into your local machine;
2. Install it;
3. Launch and Try it.


## How to install QDrink

The installation requires that you have installed the Qt framework
before.

> Accepted Qt versions are all >= v4.8.x, where x is an integer >= 0 :)

## Developing


If you are looking to improve QDrink or experiment with it by yourself then
you have to follow the ordinary social git things like that:

> git clone https://github.com/apetrovYa/QDrink.git
> goto inside the directory
> open the Qdrink.pro file with QtCreator



Now you have done! Good Job :D


## Building

If you are using QtCreator then the Qt's IDE will do the job for you.

Are you using QtCreator? No? Try it, it's nice!
Otherwise, sorry. I did not want to look boring.


If you are a **console man** then you have to type in console only
> qmake; make;
