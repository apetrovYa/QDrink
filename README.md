# QDrink
> Little stone of software developed for educational purposes


QDrink is a simple Cocktail Recipe Notes keeper. Is very tiny and flexible.
I developed it with two ideas in mind:

 1. By technological point of view: to experiment function object oriented 
    programming;
 2. By my point of view: to develop something useful from scratch for my 
    hobby "Mixology".


## Installing  / Getting Started

To let you use and try QDrink you have to do couple of things:

1. Download QDrink into your local machine;
2. Install it;
3. Launch it and Try it.


## How to install QDrink

The installation requires that you have installed the Qt framework
before. 

> Accepted Qt versions are all >= v4.8.x, where x is an integer >= 0 :) 

## Developing 


If you are looking to improve QDrink or experiment with it by yourself then
you have to follow the ordinary social git things like that:
 
> git clone https://github.com/apetrovYa/QDrink.git
> goto inside the directory
> open the Qdrink.pro file with QtCreator



Now you have done! Good Job :D


## Building 

If you are using QtCreator then the Qt's IDE will do the job for you.

Are you using QtCreator? No? Try it, it's nice! 
Otherwise, sorry. I did not want to look boring. 


If you are a **console man** then you have to look how to do manual
compilation on Qt's How-to web site. Manual compilation depends and varies 
a lot by what Operating System you use.
